# Password Generator

This is a simple program that generates a random 12-character string to be used as a password.

There are 2 options:

The "random" option creates a truly random 12-character password.

The "restricted" option creates a 12-character password that contains an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a special character.

## Usage

Run the program "password_generator.py" from the command line using python3 and following the command with the option you'd like to select. For example, if you'd like a random password to be generated, run the program as follows:

python3 password_generator.py random

If you'd like to generate a restricted password, run the program as follows:

python3 password_generator.py restricted
